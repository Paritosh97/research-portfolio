### Interaction methods for eye tracking for cognitively disabled people
In my M1 thesis, my [work](http://paritosh-sharma.com/gazeplay-interaction/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} aims at improving the eye interaction methods for [GazePlay](https://gazeplay.github.io/GazePlay/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}.


## Projects

### Simulator for Mass Spring Systems
[Demonstration](https://paritosh-sharma.com/mass-spring-simulator/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} of several algorithms for Mass Spring Systems. Such systems are utilised for simulation of cloth and hair particles in computer graphics.
