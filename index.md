## Work

My recent work has been in the fields of Computer Graphics, HCI and Computer Vision.

### Interaction methods for eye tracking for cognitively disabled people
In my M1 thesis, my [work](http://paritosh-sharma.com/gazeplay-interaction/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} aims at improving the eye interaction methods for [GazePlay](https://gazeplay.github.io/GazePlay/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}.

### Finger Tracking for Extended Reality
TODO

### Mobile VR integration for Godot
During my [GSoC 2018](http://paritosh-sharma.com/gsoc-2018/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, I worked on integrating GearVR and Google DayDream for [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}.
